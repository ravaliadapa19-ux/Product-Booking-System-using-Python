# Product-Booking-System-using-Python
## Introduction

This project implements a *Mini Cart system* that allows users to browse available products, add them to a cart, remove items, view the cart, and checkout using different payment options.
It’s built in *Python* as a *standalone script* with a simple command-line interface, demonstrating core shopping cart logic, user interaction, and payment handling.

The goal is to provide a self-contained application suitable for learning Python basics, interactive programs, and extending into a more full-featured e-commerce system.

## Features

* View available products with prices
* Add products to the cart with a specified quantity
* Remove products from the cart
* View cart contents and total price
* Checkout with customer details (name, location, phone)
* Choose payment method: Cash on Delivery (COD) or Online Payment
* Simple command-line interface
* Easy to modify and extend (e.g., add more products, persistent storage, or advanced payment options)

## Technology Stack

* Python – Core programming language
* Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) – Interactive demonstration of cart and checkout logic
* Standalone Python Script (.py) – Command-line version of the system
